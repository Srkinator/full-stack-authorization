# Fullstack Authorization Project
This is a Client + Server Side Signup/Signin Authorization project. I'm showing the usage of encrypted passwords and tokens used to authenticate requests, consumed by React/Redux application. 
```    
Client: Form validation and authenticated API requests. Custom HOC.  
```
```
Server: Passport Strategies with JWT Tokens. Bcrypt password hashing. MongoDB localy wired.    
```
